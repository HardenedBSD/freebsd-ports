OpenNMS Minion allows an OpenNMS deployment to run in a distributed manner.    

OpenNMS Minion is an instance of the Karaf OSGi service that can run
distributed OpenNMS components that are packaged as Karaf features. Minion
devices are configured with a minimum amount of information necessary to
connect to the OpenNMS machine and identify themselves to it. The operation of
each Minion is controlled from the Dominion service running on a central
OpenNMS installation.
